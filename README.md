Telemedicine is being more widely adapted by medical practices than ever before. These include eConsult programs where medical specialists review patient referrals and communicate with the patient preemptively to provide care and make recommendations.

But questions about the financial feasibility of this model abound.

How do payors determine how much to pay for each telemedicine visit?

How do payors know if telemedicine programs are saving or costing money when compared to traditional reimbursement models for in person visits?

From a clinic perspective, what is the total cost of a telemedicine visit considering all provider, support staff, and administrative costs?

Are clinics losing money by performing telemedicine instead of seeing patients in person?

Dell Medical School and the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin has teamed up to bring you this telemedicine cost effectiveness calculator to answer your questions about the cost effectiveness of any outpatient eConsult or telemedicine program.

Use [data from the Dell Medical School Gastroenterology eConsult program](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32954940/) by default 1 or enter your own parameters to calculate the cost effectiveness of telemedicine for your situation.
